# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/temp/
    - assets/images/drawable-ldpi/
    - assets/images/drawable-xxhdpi/
    - assets/storypage/
    - assets/storypage/css/
    - assets/storypage/font-my/
    - assets/storypage/images/
    - assets/storypage/js/
    - assets/storypage/pages/
    - assets/storypage/tts_anim/
    - assets/audio/
    - assets/local-json/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Dosis
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Dosis.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Regular.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/font/Dosis-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/font/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 800
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Montserrat-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/font/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/font/Montserrat-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
